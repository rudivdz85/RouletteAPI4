In this stored procedure, we're selecting the columns and filtering the data based on the specified parameters. We're using INNER JOIN to join the Orders, Employees, Shippers, Customers and Order Details tables to retrieve the necessary data.

The @EmployeeID and @CustomerID parameters are optional and can be filtered by setting them to NULL.

The results are grouped by Order Day, Employee, Customer and Shipper using the GROUP BY clause. We're also ordering the results by Order Day, Employee, Customer and Shipper using the ORDER BY clause.

To execute this stored procedure, you would use the following syntax:

EXEC pr_GetOrderSummary 
    @StartDate = '1996-07-04', 
    @EndDate = '1996-07-08', 
    @EmployeeID = NULL, 
    @CustomerID = NULL
Where @StartDate and @EndDate are the start and end dates of the order period, and @EmployeeID and @CustomerID are optional parameters to filter the results by a specific employee or customer.
